Tutedude SDE Internship Assignment
Project Title: Focus & Object Detection in Video Interviews

🎯 Objective
Build a video proctoring system that:
Detects whether a candidate is focused during an online interview.


Flags if unauthorized items (phone, books, notes, extra devices) appear in the video.



✅ Requirements
1. Frontend (Interview Screen)
Simple web page where the interviewer can see the candidate’s video.


Candidate’s video should be recorded/stored.


Real-time detection of focus & suspicious events (e.g., “User looking away”, “Phone detected”).


2. Focus Detection Logic
Use CV libraries (OpenCV, MediaPipe, TensorFlow.js, etc.).


Detect if candidate is not looking at the screen for >5 sec.


Detect if no face is present for >10 sec.


Detect multiple faces in the frame (if possible)


Log all events with timestamps.


3. Item/Note Detection
Use object detection (YOLO / TF.js) to identify:


Mobile phone


Books / paper notes


Extra electronic devices


Flag and log these events in real time.


4. Backend (Optional but Preferred)
Store logs in a database (MongoDB / MySQL / Firebase).


Provide API to fetch focus + item detection reports.


5. Reporting
Generate a Proctoring Report with:


Candidate Name


Interview Duration


Number of times focus lost


Suspicious events (multiple faces, absence, phone/notes detected)


Final Integrity Score = 100 – deductions
